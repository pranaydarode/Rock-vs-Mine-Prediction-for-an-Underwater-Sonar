Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines. It‚Äôs a classic binary classification problem, often used for underwater target detection. The dataset includes features extracted from sonar readings, and the corresponding labels indicate whether the signal represents a rock or a mine.

Dataset
The dataset utilized in this project aligns with that employed by Gorman and Sejnowski in their study on the classification of sonar signals using a neural network, titled ‚ÄúAnalysis of Hidden Units in a Layered Network Trained to Classify Sonar Targets.‚Äù

Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies (Python, scikit-learn, pandas, etc.). You can find the necessary packages in the requirements.txt file.
Explore the Jupyter Notebook (Rock_vs_Mine.ipynb) to understand the step-by-step process.
Preprocess the data, including feature scaling and handling any missing values.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the classification model using the training data.
Evaluate the model‚Äôs performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Predict rock or mine for new sonar signals using the trained model.
Model
We‚Äôve used a logistic regression model for this classification task. Feel free to experiment with other algorithms such as random forests or support vector machines.

Training
Load the dataset.
Preprocess the features (scaling, handling missing values, etc.).
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train the logistic regression model.
Tune hyperparameters if necessary.
Evaluation
Accuracy: Overall correctness of predictions.
Precision: Proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
Recall: Proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances.
F1-score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Results
Our model achieved an accuracy of approximately 85% on the test set. Further optimization and feature engineering could improve the performance.
